particle governed by hydrodynamic interactions, adhesive interactions, and wall effects
	particle trap > arbitrary
	adhesion mediated by tethers > spring is O(1) near-wall
	adhesion via direct ligand-receptor interaction > kc << 1 lubrication
langevin framework for a Brownian particle
	langevin dynamics (markovian process)
		1. force balance
		2. fluctuation-dissipation theorem
		3. white noise says particle has no memory
			>>> gives exponential decay of velocity
		corresponding PDE is Fokker-Plank
	FP eqn shows dU/dt ~= 0 so we go back to Lengevin and drop time
	this gives the brownian dynamics solution
	diffusivity is a function of particle position
	under Einstein framework this depends on a drag term
	correlation of the random force then gives us the correct diffusivity
	and the corresponding eqn to Brownian is Smoluchowski equation similar to Fick's law
	"fluid molecules are smeared as a continuum medium providing an instantaneous viscous drag"
this motivates our use of a generalized langevin equation GLE
	drag coefficient is convoluted with particle velocity
	particle motion has its own memory, depends on position and velocity, or its history
	since particle displaces fluid, we must also consider linearized Navier Stokes
	now we have brownian particle in incompressible fluid
	we must add a no-slip BC on particle
	final term has
		1. stokes drag
		2. displaced fluid effect
		3. diffusion of fluid momentum
		and these equals the hydrodynamic force on the surface
	then we add thermal fluctuations and total fluid hydrodynamic drag
	the time-dependent drag is a combination of white and colored noise (with algebraic correlation function)
GLE captures correct hydrodynamic correlations for Brownian particle in bulk
	simulation vs analytical both give intial exponential decay
	then algebraic decay at longer timescales
	Onsager's regression hypothesis:
		in the linear regime, the relaxation of macroscopic non-equilibrium disturbances is governed by the same laws as the regression of spontaneous microscopic fluctuations at equilibrium
		allowing us to simulate GLE stochastically and determ
now add a bounding wall
	scaling of particle VACF over different time scales for particle moving perpendicular to wall predicted in literature vs our approximation
	our new approximation is that fluid momentum reflects between the particle surface and confining wall, leading to a faster decay in the VACF
propose a composite GLE that automatically captures the correct scalings in the VACF for different spatial regimes for all times
	the result is a Non-Markovian, non-stationary
	we introduce "trial bridging functions"
	the proposed GLE captures the faster decay of VACF in the lubrication layer
	this gives a markovian, stationary result in our (newest?) GLE
validate the composite GLE with Franosh and Jeney 2009
	the stoachastic simulation agrees with deterministic one if we have enough realizations / statistics
then we see results which show the interplay of hydrodynamics and adhesive interactions
	she shows VACF and also postition autocorrelation
	the presence of a harmonic potential for adhesive interaction leads to oscillations in VACF at t~t_k
	correlation of particle displacement PACF decays approximately at the timescale where the particle velocity decorrelates with the initial velocity
effect of hydrodynamics on the detachment rage k_off?
	the stochastic simulation tells us instantaneous particle trajectory
	characterize the reaction kinetics of the process
	we calculate the detachment rate constant via reactive flux formalism
	both wall-hydridynamics and binding free energy impact the reaction rate constant for NC binding
	hydrodynamic resistance or weaker interaction potential yields smaller rate constant (?? neat)
	lubrication force enhances the detachment rate, in contrast to the bulk
	lubrication gives lift, helps particle jump out of the barrier
the aim is to develop predictive pharmacodynamic models for targeted drug delivery
	we want to know where drug-loaded NP actually goes
efficiently computable approach for multiscale bridging
	dynamical density functional theory is used for obtaining RBC cross-vessel distribution and hence the marginating force in the vessel
	also add adhesion: incorporation of transient dynamics of NC and glygocalyx resistance and receptor protein relaxation
Questions
	TomL: which calculus do you use on the langevin dynamics 
		if zeta depends on position, the result depends on the calculus
		sometimes need Ito calculus, other one is "trodamuch..."
		in order to get Smolu from Brownian you have to specify the calulus (Ito easiest for numerical)
	question about the paper she compared to: it was a harmonic trapped particle analytical/experiment near a wall
		but it didn't have 
	Arujun asks about what lubrication means
		Ravi says that it means that the squeezing of the fluid creates a convective force
		I thought this was common knowledge but may be a chemical engineering thing
	arjun asks about experimentally tunable parameters regarding the fluid
		ravi says that the antibody binding and density and multivalency will affect the adhesion strength and that will have a big outcome
		and he suggests modifying this in the experiments to really make contact
		TomL says that then ravi must be measuring bound/unbound probability but not watching them come on and off?
		Hammer does experiments on a cell in real time or something
		but 100nm particles can be resolved so we can't see when they come off
		could do this for micron size
		so we only have theory and density
		Arjun and Tom recommend a toy experiment that resembles the calculation, where you change potential by pulling particles off with a trap
			or evanescent wave
		ravi asks if arjun is interested in bistable potential solution near the wall
			he says he might be a bit interested
