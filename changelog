RPB is running aamd-structures on dirac. 
Added mset = MembraneSet() to the batch calculation scripts, otherwise they don't do multiple pickles.
Also started the changelog, which you are reading right now.

2013.11.26.1900
RPB is working on stress code, combining it with the smoother.

2013.11.26.2000
RPB added a .gitignore to the root directory to drop pyc files since git is complaining that we will lose some changes.

2013.11.26.2115
RPB fixed some of the commit messages by rebase.

2013.11.27.1100
RPB did major overhaul of stress-smoother. Still in-progress.

2013.11.29.2000
Major overhauls to the pressure tensor code to handle batch studies of the maps with parameter sweeps, etc.

Summary of current stress tensor workflow
	It's necessary to explain these codes because they have lots of bells and whistles
	This all needs cleaned up and better commented.
	Right now, you have to run script-cgmd-structures.py and create a structure pickle.
	Simultaneously run the framewise pressure analysis.
	Third step is to run script-prostproc-stress-smooth-beta.py
	In this file you have to specify the framewise out name, the location of the stress tensor files, and the analysis descriptor
	When that's done, use stressdecomp and structures to run the reproc script
	This needs cleaned up and the pickles need to be organized properly
